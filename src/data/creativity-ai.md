## What's happening?

As I write this, the internet is filled with people creating Studio Ghibli style mimic images using AI. Some are launching new ventures, some celebrating relationships, and some are just riding the hype wave generated by these AI image generators.
Meanwhile, a niche conversation is happening around the ethics and potential downsides of AI-generated art, particularly when it emulates beloved, distinct human-created styles.

For me, Ghibli studios represent some of the finest animation the world has ever seen. I've always felt that a significant part of that magic comes from the palpable passion and dedication of the human artists who poured their souls into those frames <sup>[1](https://x.com/anime_twits/status/1905182428513050667)</sup>.

## My take on this debate

I find myself split when considering this mimicry applied to something that feels inherently reflective of purity in humans.

On one hand, as someone who loves to create, I see the potential. Creativity might no longer be a prisoner of resources. Imagine having a story and wanting to produce animation – the barriers of heavy budgets, complex software, and finding artists seem lower, potentially democratizing creation.

But on the other hand, as an observer and longtime movie watcher, something intangible seems missing. Art, for me, has often been a veil between the tangible world and imagination. The romance movies I watch don't mirror my real-life experiences with love, yet they often portray the emotion of love more satisfyingly through imaginative storytelling.

I vividly remember staring at "The Spacewalk" photo <sup>[2](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/astronaut-bruce-mccandless-performs-the-first-untethered-spacewalk/)</sup> as a child, imagining the vastness of universe – a feeling undiminished even today, fully knowing I'll likely never be there. For a single image to evoke such profound, personal emotions speaks to the power of human perspective that art can capture and convey.

This raises the question: can AI, trained to replicate a style, truly replicate that filter, or just the surface appearance?

## So what's the answer?

So these Ghibli-style AI images - Is it "art"? A framework I use whenever any discussion on art comes up is - "3Ns": Nuance, Novelty, and Narrative.

Applying this lens, especially as someone familiar with Studio Ghibli's legacy, the initial assessment seems clear:

- Nuance: Often low. AI replicates surface aesthetics but typically misses the subtle, intentional choices and deep emotional resonance master animators embed in their work.

- Novelty: Arguably low. The method (AI generation) is new, but the style is derivative, mimicking a well-established aesthetic rather than creating something truly original.

- Narrative (Inherent): Limited. A single generated image might depict a scene, but it can't convey something more or better than what the original picture did.

From this viewpoint, it might seem straightforward to dismiss these AI creations as lacking artistic merit compared to the originals.

However, this perspective assumes a shared context and understanding of the source material. Consider the story shared by Balram Vishwakarma <sup>[3](https://x.com/DearthOfSid/status/1906339073956135259/)</sup>: His cousin's wife in rural Bihar, unfamiliar with Ghibli's work but captivated by the dreamy, animated style was touched by seeing herself portrayed with a softness and beauty she hadn't felt entitled to before.

Suddenly, the 3Ns shift dramatically:

- For her, the Nuance wasn't about comparing it to Miyazaki, but about experiencing a visual gentleness applied to herself, perhaps for the first time.

- The Novelty was immense; the entire aesthetic was a new, enchanting way of seeing.

- And the Narrative? It wasn't just the image's content, but the powerful, deeply personal story created by the experience – the narrative of being seen, of feeling worthy of beauty, of accessing a "fairytale" moment. As Vishwakarma puts it, "The image might be fake, but the emotion was real."

Yes, these tools can flatten a style built on soul and painstaking human effort. Yet, they can also provide unexpected windows, "a crack in the wall", allowing people often relegated to the background to experience themselves, and perhaps beauty itself, in a new light, even if just for a moment. The answer, then, isn't a simple yes or no, but deeply intertwined with individual experience and access.

## Why I thought of this today?

Yesterday, I watched the re-release of Interstellar on the big screen – still incredible. Later, I stumbled upon AI-generated images depicting key Interstellar scenes in the Ghibli style. While technically interesting, something felt undeniably absent. It wasn't just the medium change; it lacked that ineffable quality – "soul," perhaps – stemming from human intention, struggle, and experience.

Seeing a style from creators known for resisting crass commercialization and prioritizing artistic integrity, being replicated so easily and often superficially... it felt different. Who knows what tensions the future awaits.
