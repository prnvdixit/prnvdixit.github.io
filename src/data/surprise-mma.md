Martial Arts is where the bully and the bullied both end up.
Even the skinniest person can cause you damage, so martial arts enable you to fight less in a way. It teaches you how less you can damage even with full knowledge of fighting.

It also makes you understand how you've nothing to prove to anyone so you would walk away from fights much more easily.

MMA training and sparring feels like I could finally breathe again even if everything else in my life is crashing over because when I am there, there waiss no other choice but to be in the moment. Martial arts have a funny way of contextualising your problems, like yes your personal problems can be annoyed but it still probably won't hurt as much as the 15 year old that's been training since he can walk. I have a hard time focusing on one thing and I tend to overthink a lot and stress myself out, but when I'm in the ring, my mind doesn't wander like that. Swimming is same for me.

I think if you choose a good academy, martial arts can be such a good community because it doesn't matter who you are, if you are showing up and putting in the work even if you aren't the best they will respect you.

It's a no-brainer but I feel martial arts reinforced in me (harshly) that if you really want something, you have to work for it. It also affirmed to me that I was truly always capable of doing something, as long as I at least tried.

Plus, it opened up my eyes to the infinite world of martial arts wisdom, iconic figures like Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Abdulmanap really inspired me as I got older to always be patient, modest.
