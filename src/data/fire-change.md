I got into FIRE on the Mr Money Mustache forums and other early adopter blogs. At that time, it was a movement that seemed to be focused not just on personal finance, but an entire philosophy surrounding waste, consumerism, environmentalism and a kind of rejection of unbridled capitalism.
It seemed to be a way to exist in a world you couldn't change, but still be able to own your time.

It seems to me that this movement has become just another "make as much as you can and buy lots of shit," sort of anti philosophical movement.

I'm retiring early not because I want to be rich, but because I have so much passion for life and work gets in the way. I want to write more novels, garden, run, lift, bake, create music.... Art, creation—that's the joy in life. And it doesn't break the bank.

There’s more people who make a lot of money than want to live frugally. They took it over.

Old story of the monk and his friend. The friend said to the monk:
"If you just pander to the king, you wouldn't have to live like a pauper."
To which the monk replied:
"If you just lived like a pauper, you wouldn't have to pander to the king!"
