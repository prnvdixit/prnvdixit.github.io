## God?!

Let's address this right away. Whenever the topic of "god" arises, the immediate question is often: "How do you know such an omnipotent being exists?"

In my experience, individuals who believe in such an entity are often seeking to understand existential and fundamental questions, such as: "Is there a meaning to our conscious existence on Earth?" or "What created such a precision in universe which can be explained by governing laws?". Belief in a god-like entity provides an answer, even when it's impossible to prove that you've the correct answer (if it was possible - we won't be having these many religions).

As for me, I enjoy finding questions I do not have answers to. I have a whole list of them on my phone, for any time I'm bored or on a long walk. I personally prefer to rather have right answers than comfortable answers - I recall Feynman taught me that <sup>[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkhBcLk_8f0)</sup>.

## How different religions explain belief?

Aha! That's a good one. Based on my understanding of philosophies I've studied, I can offer an interpretation (feel free to correct me if you have a better one).

1. Christianity:

"There are reasons to believe in Christ, but to understand these reasons first you must believe in Christ". <sup>[2](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/faith/)</sup>

How ingenious, right? To me, this mirrors my perception of love - without any checklists, and just happens. All the qualities that you cherish about a person, they become apparent <u>after</u> you're already in love with them. To put it simply, imagine you admire beautiful eyes in your partner. You can't simply search for people with beautiful eyes and expect to fall in love. Instead, I genuinely believe that when you fall in love with someone, their eyes become the most beautiful you've ever seen.

2. Hinduism:

"You can only understand the reasons after you've achieved complete knowledge, or moksha".

Simple? Once you know everything there is to know (and reach a stage called enlightenment) - you will understand the necessity of belief in God. Hinduism outlines four paths to enlightenment: Service (_karma-yoga_), Knowledge (_jnana-yoga_), Worship (_bhakti-yoga_) and Meditations (_raja-yoga_). <sup>[3](https://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_8/writings_prose/four_paths_of_yoga.htm)</sup> I can go into detail of these and their clever yet subtle presence in Hindu texts in future notes.

3. Buddhism:

"You can only experience the divine, which resides within you".

This one is challenging to articulate textually - it is meant to be experienced directly. For me, a partial understanding of this experience came through observing physical changes in my body after a few days of regular _sadhna_ - simple Buddhist way to focus<sup>[4](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/phimp/3521354.0014.021/1)</sup>.

4. Islam:

"Submit to god, and in following his command you find peace, purpose and guidance".

I don't recall encountering any explicit "proof of God" within the Qur'anic commentaries I've read. However this may just reflect limitations in interpretations I've come across so far. You see - the Qur'an is believed to have been composed during the time poetry was prevalent in Arab culture. Poets often repurpose words, giving them new meanings that must be understood only in that context. For instance, _pyaar mein jalna_ (literal translation: Burning in the fire of love) doesn't involve any literal physical burning but can be easily misinterpreted to mean so. Similarly in Islam - words like "the hour" carry a much deeper significance than their common usage.

## Why did I think of this today?

I went to watch this newly released movie "Chhaava" on screen today. There was a beautiful story arc weaved around the relationship between Chhatrapati Sambhaji and his wife, Yeshu. Throughout this arc, Yeshu frequently anticipates Chhatrapati's thoughts and responds before he can even verbalize them. At a later point, Chhatrapati asks her "You know everything Yeshu; can you tell me what my mother looked like?" To which Yeshu responds "How can I know it? I reside only in your heart; so if your heart doesn't know then neither would I!"

And this exchange threw me into a rabbit-hole of "How can one know the unknowable?" leading me to "How do we explain what caused something if the cause was not there before the consequence? Like love?" and ultimately, "Assuming a person's natural state is non-belief, how can one come to believe in god before embracing a religion?".

P.S. I ran after 5 years - first ever 5k at that too. ![Run stats](/data/pics/1-5k-run.png)
