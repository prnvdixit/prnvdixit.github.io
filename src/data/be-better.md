## Why I thought of this today?

I was reading a very old journal entry of mine (reminds me I need to start journaling again!) and realised how frequently I've changed my opinion about things which I used to believe whole-heartedly at some point in life. Some times it happened over time with experiences, other times someone explicitly told me about it. And that is something I want to capture maybe as a trajectory of growth that is happening on a day-to-day basis in my life. I can come back to it and remind myself of it then.

> This is a work in progress note, so I'll keep updating it when I come across other vices within me :)

## Stickler

I believed there's only one way to live the life, the right way. Everything was so easy to cloak under "I have high standards", but the "standards" happen to just what was convenient to me. It was some level of self-esteem issues within, where I felt good and reassured after thinking I'm better than others.
Over time I am developing that same level of empathy to other's struggles and other's choices that I have for strangers to ones who are close too. Talking to a lot of people and knowing their stories - from cab drivers to random train passengers - helps with knowing that everyone is going through something always.

## Disagreements

Disagreeing right takes every little ounce of courage and empathy. Courage to accept that you're a volatile. Empathy to figure out other person's negotiables and non-negotiables. I'm still learning to convey my feelings. And to take a break when I feel flooded with emotions.
The tendency is to drop out of your heart and into your head to solve problems, so much conflict used to be just trying to negotiate which particular way would be best to return to “safety”, to the place where I feel good. Over time I have started to realize, it’s so easy to forget that the goal was always to spend as much time heart-centered as possible and just doing things that inspire the heart. So I'm beginning to leave my brain out of disagreements.

## Patience

Whenever I start anything - from training to relationships - my immediate impulse is to see if I'm comfortable with level-hard of it. And that may work with inanimate objects but not with people. Because it is easy to track your progress on hobbies , but People? I used to have a constant need of reassurance that I'm doing best by their standards. In these situations, my anxiety would take over, discipline and patience will go to trash, and every disagreement becomes urgent requiring a conversation. I have started treating Patience as my only answer now.
