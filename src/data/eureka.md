This note will contain everything that I discover around me and don't have enough content or time to write a separate blog post about.

I’m reading a book about decision-making written by a poker player, and she points out that “resulting” is misattribution — thinking a bad outcome means you made a bad choice. Your decisions may have been sound, even if it turned out poorly bc you were unlucky. Try to disentangle results from the choices that landed you where you are. If you were acting reasonably with limited information, don’t question yourself in the aftermath. Hindsight is always 20/20

betrayal is traumatic because the end leaves you questioning if you can trust your own perception. if the whole thing was fake. how you missed the signs. who and what is safe anymore
