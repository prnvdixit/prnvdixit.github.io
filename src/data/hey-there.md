> "I will try my best to ensure that you never see my face again. All the best!"

Those were his last words to her. In their final, forty-second, meeting.

In the first week, he felt at peace. Almost like a load off his shoulders and mind. He'd be lying if he said otherwise. He was faintly seduced by the idea of counting every time she had hurt him, every time he felt unseen, every sleepless night, every hobby he had abandoned in his anxiety, every time she refused to talk about their issues, every time he told his truths and every time he was told lies, every time he kissed her forehead and it felt like only he wanted it.

But soon, he realized, he wasn't being fair to himself or her. Or to the thousands of people he'll meet in the future.

He had always been a good, calm, kind and secure person — like a koi pond — until he entered that relationship. He dropped all his guards to give love a chance without any boundaries, and all his insecurities, vices, weaknesses, and toxic traits surfaced like dead fish in that same koi pond. This relationship showed him that he wasn't as patient, kind, or forgiving as he had thought he was.

But these flaws can't be excuses, right?

He too can't expect her to see the "gravels" in his life or what he was going through. That would be an excuse. He just hopes he never has an excuse in the future, and that no one ever sees this side of him again.

He hopes that some day, the definition of emotional intelligence will also include when someone’s heart is into it, even if their tools aren’t sharp yet. He was still figuring things out, learning how to untangle his survival habits. He was yet to find a language to navigate conflict between them. He liked them together for the potential, for what things would have been if everything aligned, for the softness and kindness that she showed _sometimes_. But none of it was reality, none of it was her.

He believes that regret is a cruel storyteller. It rewrites the past with the wisdom of the present, convinces you that you should have known better when you actually had no way of knowing at all. So he keeps no regrets in life. He makes mistakes, and then does the work to ensure the same mistakes don't happen again on a second chance sometime in future. He forgives himself for not knowing earlier what only time could teach.

So yes, he holds no anger towards her anymore. He only holds the sadness that he left her no other option than to end things. He's sad for pushing her to such a filthy corner that she was willing to lie about her infidelity just to get him away faster, and further.
And now he can remember all the things which were good about her too. How she used to keep telling him reasons of why he was the best person she has met in life. Well, correction, he will be the best temporary person she will ever meet in life.

Every person has a gap between their self-image and their reality. He now has a chance to reduce it. He doesn't want to lie to people, or worse, to himself. This will be a journey. It will be a slow process, and something in him will change for the better. The only commitment he can make right now is to that process. He has the time, the 2700 sunrises he is yet to see in this life.
And he has the courage.

Old paradigms on which he built his life on, are going to collapse. The identity created around outcomes is going to crumble. Susceptibility to those fantasies about the future, in the hope or fear of how things may turn out, has to go away. Bad bargains like giving up his dreams just to escape his nightmares, no more.

He still hasn't read her last message, it is still unopened from weeks ago. He only wishes he had noticed the incompatibility with her before it was this late. This would have never worked, just because they are two kind people who can't keep choosing each other when things go bad. May they both find someone who can.

He found contentment in their beginning.

He was anxious in her presence.

He was surprised by their parting.

He was sad when things settled.

He has peace lingering in the background now, as a mere shadow with no one to share.
