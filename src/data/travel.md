> I wrote this a decade ago in 2016 and it was sitting in my email drafts until today. I feel this explains why I naturally feel drawn towards solo travelling so much and how far I've come from that reserved quite kid who used to second guess every interaction. I wanted to talk to strangers and people even then just didn't know how. And now I know. Maybe this hits harder right now because I've barely travelled in past 2 years, here's to expecting that changes this year xD

First, let me tell you something. I'm really bad at initiating conversations.

Recently I have come across many new friends and a few strangers, whom I badly wanna know. I want to talk to them, have midnight long conversations with them. I want to tell them my story, about my adventures, share my secrets and I just want them to listen.

Listen to me as long as I keep the things interesting. And when it get a bit boring, maybe they can start telling me things about themselves and I'll listen.

It's not like I want to be in relationship with them. Hell, no. This isn't even a gender specific thing. And it's very much okay if they all don't even end up as my friends. I'll be fine.

It's just this irresistible urge, this deep instinct shouting at me from inside to share. To share my secret, my story and things. Things that I thought I would take with me to grave.Something tells me, sharing with them will bring me calm. The calm I have been searching for, in all the wrong places. It's as if we are part of a puzzle waiting to meet and complete a picture.

But at the same time I don't want to be "THAT GUY". That guy who tells everything as if his life is an open book, is overly frank and comes across as the needy and desperate one, because I'm not that guy. I hardly share things. I don't really interact much and people don't know much about me either.

That's not all, I have this embedded fear of asking questions like, what if they don't want to talk to me? What if they judge me? What if they won't confide in me? What if things I tell them, they share with other people? What if they think I'm a weirdo?

So, even before I begin the idea of how to have a conversation with them, I reject it. But this unknown urge to share with these known strangers still lingers.

And there is nothing I can do about it because as I said, I am really bad at initiating conversations.
