Well lucky me, that's exactly what I pursue currently - while building Microsoft Teams.<br/> <br/> Apart from computers, I really enjoy reading, strolling, running, poetry, singing, mimicry and wordplays/dad-jokes.<br/> Oh I also love trains! And absolutely adore rains (I swear I didn't plan that wordplay!!) <br/> <br/> If you have any questions or just want to chat or... maybe bring some "Phineas & Ferb"-esque project to life (yasss!!), you can reach out to me on Twitter or shoot me an email<sup>[2]</sup>.<br/> <br/><br/> <div class="small-text"> <sup>[1]</sup> Vixon (Shameless plug!)<br/> <sup>[2]</sup> Well, all reasonable permutations of my name were already claimed by the time I made my Gmail (also known as good ol' door of the internet) account - so I go by @prnvdixit across the internet now. </div></div></article> <hr class="blog-end"> <div class="blog-info"> </div></div></div><hr> <div class="footer"> <ul class="options-footer"> <li class="list-in">GitHub</li><li class="list-in">Mail</li><li class="list-in">LinkedIn</li><li class="list-in">Twitter</li></ul> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link">CC BY-NC 4.0</a> <p>¬© 2021</p><p>Made with ‚ù§ by Pranav Dixit</p></div></body>
