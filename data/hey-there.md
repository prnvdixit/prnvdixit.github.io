"I will try my best to ensure that you never see my face again. All the best!"

He said that in their last, forty-second meeting before he came home.

In the first couple of days after that, he felt at peace. I'd be lying if I said otherwise. He was faintly seduced by the idea of shedding all accountability. He was counting all the times she had hurt him, all the times he felt unseen in the relationship, all the nights they spent fighting when he reached work with barely an hour of sleep, all the hobbies he had stopped making time for, all the times she acted impulsively and refused to talk about issues.

By the end of that week, after he had calmed down, he realized that he wasn't being fair to himself.

Now, after all these weeks and all that has happened, he's come to a realization. He used to think he was a good, calm, secure, peaceful person — like a koi pond — until he entered that relationship. He dropped all his guards to give a chance to love without any boundaries, and all his insecurities, vices, weaknesses, neediness, and toxic traits surfaced like dead fish in the same pond. It showed him that he wasn't as patient, kind, forgiving, or tolerant as he had originally thought.

But that is true for everyone else too, including you, me, and her. So what?

I've referenced this movie scene at least a hundred times in my life. Milkha Singh is running his first-ever race. Right before the finish line, a small piece of gravel pierces his bare feet, and he loses the race. A senior comes over and appreciates Milkha for almost winning, telling him they'll select him for the nationals. Milkha is jubilant, but his coach smiles and says,

> "[Milkhya] Every time the gravel will not be as big for people to notice it, so be so strong that no gravel can stop you"

He can't expect her to understand what "gravels" were in his life or what he was going through, and why he acted the way he did during their time together. He doesn't even want that to be an excuse. He just knows he needs to become strong enough mentally that he never has an excuse in the future. The next person he decides to be with should never see this side of him.

See, I believe every person has a gap between their self-image and their reality. I'm just happy that he got to know this gap so early on in his life that he can still reduce it. I don't want him to ever start lying to people around him, or worse, to himself, just to earn some praise. And for all I know, this is definitely going to be a journey, and fortunately, he has all the help he needs.

I told you how I have zero regrets in life. While that statement holds true over a long period of time, it doesn't mean that I've never held regrets at any point in life. If I had no regrets, what kind of introspection would I be doing to become better, right? So I make mistakes, regret them for a while, curse myself, and then work on "iron-cladding" these gaps within me to ensure it doesn't happen again.

And then I go back to the person I have hurt, to tell them how I regret what I did and that I am trying to correct that mistake with my full effort, even though it will take some time. Of course, it is up to that person if they accept a second chance. Regardless of whether they accept or not, I know I did everything in my power to undo that mistake, so I can move on with zero regrets.

So yes, he holds no anger toward her. He chooses to only hold the regret that he left her no other option than to end things without trying to work through it by talking to him, and he takes full responsibility for it. He regrets pushing her to such a filthy corner that she was planning to lie about her infidelity just to kick him away faster, further.

It will be a slow process, and something in him will change for the better. The only commitment he can make right now is to that process.

He found contentment in the beginning.

He was anxious in presence.

He was hurt in parting.

He is sad when it's settled.

He has peace lingering in background, as a mere shadow with no one to share.

He finally gathers the courage to read her last message from weeks ago, and sees that she still chose to be kind. He just wonders where he can find the courage to talk to the person who decided to push him away instead of talking it out. He stares at his unsent draft,

> "Consider this as me replacing those last harsh words said in that moment of pain with more acceptable ones. Hope you can forgive me and "call me maybe<sup>[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWNaR-rxAic)</sup>", whenever you are ready :)"
