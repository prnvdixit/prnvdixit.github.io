> "I will try my best to ensure that you never see my face again. All the best!"

He said that in their last, forty-second meeting before he came home.

In the first week after that, he felt at peace. He'd be lying if he said otherwise. He was faintly seduced by the idea of shedding all accountability. He was counting all the times she had hurt him, all the times he felt unseen in the relationship, all the nights they spent fighting when he reached work with barely an hour of sleep, all the hobbies he had stopped making time for, all the times she acted impulsively and refused to talk about issues.

By the end of that week, after he had calmed down, he realized that he wasn't being fair to himself.

Now, after all these weeks and all that has happened, he's come to a realization. He used to think he was a good, calm, secure, peaceful person — like a koi pond — until he entered that relationship. He dropped all his guards to give a chance to love without any boundaries, and all his insecurities, vices, weaknesses, neediness, and toxic traits surfaced like dead fish in the same pond. It showed him that he wasn't as patient, kind, forgiving, or tolerant as he had originally thought.

But that is true for everyone else too, including you, me, and her. So what?

Milkha Singh is running his first-ever race. Right before the finish line, a small piece of gravel pierces his bare feet, and he loses the race. A senior official comes over and appreciates Milkha for almost winning, telling him they'll select him for the nationals. Milkha is jubilant, but his coach smiles and says,

> "[Milkhya] Every time the gravel will not be as big for people to notice it, so be such that no gravel can be an excuse"

He can't expect her to understand what "gravels" were in his life or what he was going through, or why he acted the way he did during their time together. That is no excuse. He just hopes that he never has an excuse in the future. No person should ever see this side of him.

Everyone talks about emotional intelligence but he feels sometimes we overcorrect. We got so good in naming patterns, identifying red flags and protecting peace that we forgot that sometimes love isn't neat or fully healed. It was his first relationship. He was still figuring things out. He didn't show up already knowing how to untangle his survival habits. Gosh he was still learning how to show up itself. He didn't come with the wisdom of navigating conflicts in some perfect language.
I hope someone changes the definition of emotional intelligence for his sake, it should also mean when someone's heart is in it, even when their tools aren't sharp yet. And well he was trying his best to sharpen his tools. Only if they both had shown grace, maybe then they both would've had a chance.

Every person has a gap between their self-image and their reality. He's just happy that he got to know this gap so early on in his life that he can still reduce it. He doen't want him to ever start lying to people around him, or worse, to himself, just to earn some praise or prize. And for all he knows, this is definitely going to be a journey, and fortunately, he has all the help he needs.

He had told her how he has zero regrets in life. While that statement holds true over a period of time, it doesn't mean that he has never held regrets at any point in life. If he had no regrets, what kind of introspection would he be doing to become better, right? So he make mistakes, regret them for a while, curse himself, and then take up the work to ensure it doesn't happen again.

And then he goes back to the person he had hurt, to tell them how he regrets what he did and that he is trying to correct that mistake now, even though it will take some time. Of course, it is up to that person if they accept a second chance. Regardless of whether they accept or not, he can move on with zero regrets.

So yes, he holds no anger toward her. He chooses to only hold the regret, that he left her no other option than to end things without talking to him, and he takes full responsibility for it. He regrets pushing her to such a filthy corner that she was planning to lie about her infidelity just to kick him away faster, further.

It will be a slow process, and something in him will change for the better. The only commitment he can make right now is to that process.

He found contentment in the beginning.

He was anxious in presence.

He was surprised in parting.

He is sad when it's settled.

He has peace lingering in background now, as a mere shadow with no one to share.

He finally gathers the courage to read her last message from weeks ago, still lying unopened. After all this, she still choses to be kind in her message. He just wonders where he can find the courage to talk to the person who decided to push him away instead of talking it out in first place. He stares at his unsent draft,

> "Consider this as me replacing those last harsh words said in that moment of pain with more acceptable ones. Hope you can forgive me and "call me maybe<sup>[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWNaR-rxAic)</sup>", whenever you are ready :)"
