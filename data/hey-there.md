> "I will try my best to ensure that you never see my face again. All the best!"

Those were his last words to her. In their last, forty-second, meeting.

In the first week, he felt at peace. He'd be lying if he said otherwise. He was faintly seduced by the idea of shedding all accountability, counting every time she had hurt him, every time he felt unseen, every sleepless night, every hobby he had abandoned in anxiety, every time she refused to talk about their issues.

By the end of that week, his mind calmer, he realized he wasn't being fair to himself or her. After all these months, he came to a new realization.

He had always been a good, calm, secure person — like a koi pond — until he entered that relationship. He dropped all his guards to give love a chance without any boundaries, and all his insecurities, vices, weaknesses, and toxic traits surfaced like dead fish in that same koi pond. It showed him that he wasn't as patient, kind, or forgiving as he had originally thought.

But that is true for everyone, including you, me, and even her. So what?

Milkha has the answer. Milkha Singh is running his first race. Just before the finish line, a small piece of gravel pierces his bare feet, and he loses. A senior official praises him for almost winning if not for that gravel. Milkha is jubilant, but his coach smiles and says,

> "[Milkhya] Every time the gravel will not be as big for people to notice it, so be such that no gravel can be an excuse"

He can't expect her to understand the "gravels" in his life or what he was going through. That would be an excuse. He just hopes he never has an excuse in the future, and that no one ever sees this side of him again.

It was his first relationship. He was still figuring things out, learning how to untangle his survival habits and learn the language to navigate conflicts. He was still learning how to simply show up.

I hope that some day, the definition of emotional intelligence will also include when someone’s heart is in it, even if their tools aren’t sharp yet. If only they both had shown grace, maybe it would've had a chance.

Every person has a gap between their self-image and their reality. He now has a chance to reduce it. He doesn't want to lie to people, or worse, to himself. This will be a journey, and fortunately, he has all the help he needs.

He had told her he has zero regrets in life. That doesn't mean he never had any. He makes mistakes, regrets them for a while, and then does the work to ensure they don't happen again. He goes back to the person he hurt, to show them that he is trying to correct that mistake. Regardless of whether they accept a second chance, he can move on with zero regrets.

So yes, he holds no anger toward her anymore. He only holds the regret that he left her no other option than to end things. He holds full responsibility for what happened. He regrets pushing her to such a filthy corner that she was willing to lie about her infidelity just to get him away faster, and further.

It will be a slow process, and something in him will change for the better. The only commitment he can make right now is to that process.

He found contentment in their beginning.

He was anxious in her presence.

He was surprised by their parting.

He is sad now that it's settled.

He has peace lingering in background, as a mere shadow with no one to share.

He finally gathers the courage to read her last message, still unopened from months ago. After everything, she still chooses to be kind.

But now he wonders where he can find the courage to talk to the person who decided to push him away instead of talking it out. He stares at his unsent draft:

> "Consider this as me replacing those last harsh words said in that moment of pain with more acceptable ones. Hope you can "call me maybe<sup>[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWNaR-rxAic)</sup>", whenever you are ready :)"
