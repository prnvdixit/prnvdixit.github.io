> "I will try my best to ensure that you never see my face again. All the best!"

Those were his last words to her. In their final, forty-second, meeting.

In the first week, he felt at peace. He'd be lying if he said otherwise. He was faintly seduced by the idea of shedding all accountability, counting every time she had hurt him, every time he felt unseen, every sleepless night, every hobby he had abandoned in his anxiety, every time she refused to talk about their issues.

All these months later, his mind calmer, he realized he wasn't being fair to himself or her.

He had always been a good, calm, secure person — like a koi pond — until he entered that relationship. He dropped all his guards to give love a chance without any boundaries, and all his insecurities, vices, weaknesses, and toxic traits surfaced like dead fish in that same koi pond. It showed him that he wasn't as patient, kind, or forgiving as he had thought he was.

But these flaws can't be excuses, right?

He too can't expect her to see the "gravels" in his life or what he was going through. That would be an excuse. He just hopes he never has an excuse in the future, and that no one ever sees this side of him again.

He was still figuring things out, learning how to untangle his survival habits and the language to navigate conflicts. He was still learning how to simply show up. He liked them together for the potential, for what things would have been if everything aligned, for the softness and kindness that she showed _sometimes_. But none of it was reality, none of it was her, except in their last meeting.

I hope that some day, the definition of emotional intelligence will also include when someone’s heart is in it, even if their tools aren’t sharp yet. Maybe they would've had a chance then.

He holds no regrets in life. He makes mistakes, regrets them for a while, and then does the work to ensure they don't happen again. And then, and only then, can he move on with zero regrets.

So yes, he holds no anger towards her anymore. He only holds the regret that he left her no other option than to end things. He regrets pushing her to such a filthy corner that she was willing to lie about her infidelity just to get him away faster, and further.

Every person has a gap between their self-image and their reality. He now has a chance to reduce it. He doesn't want to lie to people, or worse, to himself. This will be a journey. It will be a slow process, and something in him will change for the better. The only commitment he can make right now is to that process. He has the time, the 3600 sunrises he is yet to see in this life. And he has all the help he needs.

Old paradigms on which he built his life on, are going to collapse. The identity created around outcomes is going to crumble. Susceptibility to those fantasies about the future, in the hope or fear of how things may turn out, has to go away. Bad bargains like giving up his dreams just to escape his nightmares, no more.

He finally gathers the courage to read her last message, still unopened from months ago. After everything, she still chooses to be kind.

But now he wonders where he can find the courage to talk to the person who decided to push him away instead of talking it out. He stares at his unsent draft:

> "Consider this as me replacing those last harsh words said in that moment of pain with more acceptable ones. Hope you can "call me maybe<sup>[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWNaR-rxAic)</sup>", whenever you are ready :)"

He found contentment in their beginning.

He was anxious in her presence.

He was surprised by their parting.

He was sad when things settled.

He has peace lingering in the background now, as a mere shadow with no one to share.
