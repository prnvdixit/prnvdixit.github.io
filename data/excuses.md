You'll always find excuses. Easiest way to beat fear is - "I just wanna see what I can get away with"

Violin: Long fingers and hands. Left hand dominant
Swimming: Breathing problems since childhood, hospitalized as baby
MMA: Wear glasses

Go with the idea - "I just wanna see"

Embarassment is an underexplored emotion, go out there and make a fool of yourself

Allow yourself to be moved by the fragility of life. Succumb to the sensations of exuberant beauty. Be intrigued by the uniqueness of others. Seek internal stillness amongst the never-ending changes of the world. Find what inspires your soul & let it transform you. Feel a sense of urgency to live more rich & fully. Ceaselessly yearn to know God, conform to His image, and conduct His will. Search for Wisdom, discernment, & understanding always. Pray & toil all your days while making grand use of your leisure. And may you give love a chance to reach the innermost depths of your heart, shatter it, & make it whole. To live well is of utmost priority or there is not much a point to living at all

Was watching ‘Interstellar’ and got reminded of one of the most beautiful (and powerful) concept of science that I use for my own growth path or life choice - ‘Escape Velocity’.
I have a strong belief that every thing, place, person or attachment can keep us tethered only till it reaches a specific point beyond which we just break-off and are propelled free of emotional shackles. That non negotiable point of no-return can take us inwards or outwards but invariably for better.
And only a free & clear heart can muse in hindsight and wonder at missing the signs, red-flags or manipulations that delayed the inevitable escape.
Also, although sometimes it’s good to be as stretchable as a spring but the problem of being a spring is that it does not break, it loses it’s shape & identity when kept on getting pulled for a long time. A spring can’t cut off. Humans can and should.

Start telling yourself "I love it" every time something bad happens about a hobby. Couldn't land that kick? I love it. Couldn't play that note? I love it. Couldn't progress weights? I love it. Couldn't swim a new form? I love it.
Even if you can't find a positive aspect of it, just say "I love it". Train your brain into embracing everything, positive or negative.
All these challenges make the final story better.
