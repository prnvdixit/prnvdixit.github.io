You'll always find excuses. Easiest way to beat fear is - "I just wanna see what I can get away with"

Violin: Long fingers and hands. Left hand dominant
Swimming: Breathing problems since childhood, hospitalized as baby
MMA: Wear glasses

Go with the idea - "I just wanna see"

Embarassment is an underexplored emotion, go out there and make a fool of yourself

Allow yourself to be moved by the fragility of life. Succumb to the sensations of exuberant beauty. Be intrigued by the uniqueness of others. Seek internal stillness amongst the never-ending changes of the world. Find what inspires your soul & let it transform you. Feel a sense of urgency to live more rich & fully. Ceaselessly yearn to know God, conform to His image, and conduct His will. Search for Wisdom, discernment, & understanding always. Pray & toil all your days while making grand use of your leisure. And may you give love a chance to reach the innermost depths of your heart, shatter it, & make it whole. To live well is of utmost priority or there is not much a point to living at all
