## The nature of Evil

Evil, in my experience, is an inherent potential in humans. It typically requires a catalyst to manifest - isolation is a potent one. I tend to conceptualize evil as a drug which gives you momentary euphoria at the cost of lasting damage on self and/or others.
The "Rat park studies"<sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park)</sup>, for instance, illustrate that if you give unlimited cocaine to a rat in a cage it will often ingest it until it dies. Conversely, when given unlimited cocaine to a free rat in a communal environment, it usually ignores it.

While I have my own skepticism around Gandhi's approach towards politics, my admiration for the man remains absolute - particularly for his unwavering belief in a non-violent approach, especially when it seemed unattainable.

## Navigating the narrative of Fact and Fiction

"When we cease to understand the world"<sup>[2](https://www.amazon.in/When-We-Cease-Understand-World/dp/1782276122)</sup> is presented as a work of partial fiction drawing upon real life events. This evokes memories of Assassin's Creed (what fond memories of this game).
I also recall how a lot of historians were critical of historical inaccuracies in Assassin's Creed games - a sentiment I now better understand. As someone who loves Physics, I found the whole blending of fiction and facts presented in this book somewhat destabilizing and not entirely enjoyable. Throughout the narrative, you'd encounter elements which make you think - "that can't be true" - yet are rooted in reality. Ultimately, the responsibility for distinguishing between the two falls squarely on the reader.

I do like the style of writing (perhaps credit to translator for that) mostly - some lines really made me close my Kindle and sit in silence, reflecting. One such excerpt is included at the [end of this note](#reflection-passage).

## Good and bad - and a warning for our times

Schrodinger's chapter, I confess I read rather quickly - it felt too drawn out and a very uncomfortable storyline. Heisenberg's account, conversely, was fascinating. Haber's story was largely familiar to me, him being a "genius rat" in a "cage of circumstances" with his "drug of patriotism". That story as my professor, a war veteran and an ex-IPS officer, described it when introducing "Haber-Bosch process" made me uneasy then - and still makes me uneasy now.

Grothendieck's story presents contradictions of genius, a theme I feel will become increasingly pertinent as the most gifted minds of this generation turn their attention to Biotech and AI. When a Nobel prize winner of Physics is inclined to spend less time acknowledging peers and more time issuing warnings on the implications of his work<sup>[3](https://youtu.be/-icD_KmvnnM?t=137)</sup>, we may not be paying attention to the only thing history has to offer - lessons.

The recurring appearances of Einstein are also noteworthy. Perhaps somewhat naively, I love how the author has paid homage to one of the greats, while also depicting his vulnerable side, particularly in his passionate defense during quantum mechanics and his enduring quest for a unified theory.

## <a name="reflection-passage"></a> Schwarzschild's chilling insight

For those familiar with Physics, the words "Singularity" and "Schwarzschild's radius" are likely not unfamiliar terms. Schwarzschild's work in theorizing black holes - challenging even the great Einstein's theories - is significant. Schwarzschild theorized that when a giant star collapses into a single point, the equations of general relativity will break at that point. Time will freeze. Space will curve intensely.
This point is called Singularity. Schwarzschild's radius, then, denotes the boundary of no return around a black hole, beyond which not even light can escape.

Schwarzschild, whose work predates Holocaust, finds a metaphor for singularity in human psyche,

> If matter were prone to birthing monsters of this kind, were there correlations with the human psyche? Could a sufficient concentration of human will — millions of people exploited for a single end with their minds compressed into the same psychic space — unleash something comparable to the singularity? A point of no return for generations to come.

I simply looked out of the cab window in silence for the next 15 minutes after reading these lines, and told this to a colleague as soon as I got to the office.
