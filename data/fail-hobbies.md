## What Psychology says about failure?

Psychology tells us that when we consistently face failure — our belief in our ability to influence things, even in other areas can start to shrink — unless you... read until [next](#fix) section. You may have encountered this idea as a buzzword "agency" [online](https://x.com/search?q=%40naval%20%22agency%22%20since%3A2024-02-09%20until%3A2025-02-09&src=typed_query&f=top) — though I'll present a more comprehensible explanation.

**(P.S. NOT endorsing Naval. Just that I realized while researching for this blog that everyone seems to quote him when using this word :))**

In this experiment, a teacher gives two groups of students different exams, both with three questions. The trick? The first two questions in both set of papers are wildly different — they're practically unsolvable for first group; and a breeze for the second group. The third question is same for everyone though.
Now even though that third question was identical for both groups - it's mostly the students in second group who were able to crack it. This illustrates the idea of <u>_learned helplessness_</u> - where the students in first group practically gave up, because of their prior experience of powerlessness overriding their ability to even attempt an easy problem.

The original experiment from 1960s - the golden age of psychology in my personal opinion - is far too brutal to explain here. I'll leave that to curious minds. You were warned.

## So what's the fix?

Well, like most things in psychology there's no _magic fix_ - it's fundamentally about understanding a human tendency. And simply being aware of this phenomenon is a step towards regaining control. A helpful strategy to internalize this idea is to intentionally engage in low-stakes activities where failure is okay, even expected. Eventually, by consistently realizing that most failure can be actually attributed to external factors like — the difficulty of the challenge or your own lack of specific preparation — you may start noticing changes within you on how your perception of failure has changed too.

## Why did I think of this today?

I started learning swimming ~5 months back. But it's only this week I am starting with Butterfly style, which in my opinion is the hardest style of swimming in terms of maintaining form. And though I am reasonably proficient in breaststroke, freestyle and backstroke now - I am still struggling with even doing basic movements in butterfly from the first day. Hell, I can't even push my hips out of water while floating. So while I used to swim 25m lane in other styles like a "champ" - now I'm back to beginners lane for butterfly. And that's gotta sting.

But honestly, it doesn't sting as much as when I started breaststroke. I remember how I went through same rollercoaster with breaststroke too - same phases of "I'm never going to learn this", followed by "Okay, I'm getting a hang of this" and finally "Wow - I can do this?".

It's important to highlight here that swimming is a relatively low-stakes pursuit for me - so failing at it doesn't really register with my otherwise overthinking mind. To be honest, even if I entered a swimming race and completely bombed, it wouldn't bother me much. The reason is simply that I don't see myself as 'a swimmer' in any deep sense. Perhaps I should touch upon the idea of identity in modern lifestyle some other day - there's a fascinating idea from sociology I want to dwell on.
