## What Psychology says about failure?

Psychology tells us that when we consistently face failure — our belief in our ability to influence things, even in other areas can start to shrink — unless you... read until [next](#fix) section.

You may have encountered this idea as a buzzword "agency" [online](https://x.com/naval/status/1818901132020007376) — though I'll present a more comprehensible explanation.
(P.S. not endorsing Naval's ideas)

In this experiment, a teacher gives two groups of students different exams, both with three questions. The trick? The first two questions in both set of papers are wildly different — they're practically unsolvable for first group; and a breeze for the second group. The third question is same for everyone though.
Now even though that third question was identical for both groups - it's only the second group who were able to crack it. This illustrates the idea of _learned helplessness_ - where the students in first group practically gave up, because of their prior experience of powerlessness overriding their ability to even attempt an easy problem.

The original experiment from 1960s - the golden age of psychology in my personal opinion - is far too brutal to explain here. I'll leave that to curious minds - beware! you were warned.

## So what's the fix?

Well, like most things in psychology there's no _magic fix_ - it's fundamentally about understanding a human tendency. And simply being aware of this phenomenon is a step towards regaining control. A helpful strategy to internalize this idea is to intentionally engage in low-stakes activities where failure is okay, even expected. Eventually, by consistently realizing that most failure can be actually attributed to external factors like — the difficulty of the challenge or your own lack of specific preparation — you will start noticing changes within you.

## Why did I think of this today?

I started learning swimming ~5 months back. But it's only this week I am starting with Butterfly style, which arguably is the hardest style of swimming in form. And though I am reasonably proficient in breaststroke, freestyle and backstroke now - I am still struggling with even doing basic movements in butterfly from the first day. Hell, I can't even push my hips out of water while floating. So while I used to swim 25m lane in other styles like a "champ" - now I'm back to beginners lane for butterfly. And that's gotta sting.

But honestly, it doesn't sting as much as when I started breaststroke. I remember how I went through same rollercoaster with breaststroke too - same phases of "I'm never going to learn this", followed by "Okay, I'm getting a hang of this" and finally "Wow - I can do this?".

It's important to highlight here that swimming is a relatively low-stakes pursuit for me - so failing at it doesn't really register with my otherwise overthinking mind. To be honest, even if I entered a swimming race and completely bombed, it wouldn't bother me much. The reason is simply that I don't see myself as 'a swimmer' in any deep sense. Perhaps I can touch upon the idea of identity in modern lifestyle some other day - there's a fascinating idea from sociology I want to dwell on.

This basically explains why I have like a gazillion entries in hobbies I want to try, though I'm only done with 2 so far.
