# GraphQL vs REST API Design

A detailed comparison of GraphQL and REST API architectures, exploring their strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use cases.

## Understanding REST

- Architectural principles
- Resource-based routing
- HTTP methods and their usage
- Status codes and error handling

## GraphQL Fundamentals

- Schema definition
- Queries and mutations
- Resolvers
- Type system

## Key Differences

### Data Fetching

- REST: Multiple endpoints for different resources
- GraphQL: Single endpoint for all queries

### Over/Under Fetching

- REST: Fixed response structure
- GraphQL: Client-specified response structure

### Caching

- REST: HTTP-level caching
- GraphQL: Custom caching implementation

## Performance Considerations

### REST

- Network requests optimization
- Response compression
- API versioning

### GraphQL

- Query complexity
- Batching requests
- Pagination strategies

## Best Practices

1. Choose based on project requirements
2. Consider team expertise
3. Evaluate maintenance overhead
4. Plan for scalability
5. Document extensively

## Tools and Resources

- API testing tools
- Documentation generators
- Client libraries
- Monitoring solutions

Remember that neither approach is universally better - the choice depends on your specific use case, team capabilities, and project requirements.
