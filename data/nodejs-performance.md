- Memory leaks detection and prevention
- Heap memory optimization techniques

## Event Loop Optimization

- Avoiding event loop blocking
- Proper use of async/await
- Managing I/O operations efficiently

## Caching Strategies

- Implementing Redis for caching
- In-memory caching techniques
- Cache invalidation strategies

## Code Optimization

- Using streams for large data
- Implementing worker threads
- Optimizing database queries

## Monitoring and Profiling

- Using Node.js profiler
- Performance metrics tracking
- Load testing strategies

## Best Practices

1. Use the latest Node.js version
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Optimize your dependencies
4. Use clustering for CPU-intensive tasks
5. Implement proper logging

## Tools and Resources

- Node.js profiler
- Performance monitoring tools
- Debugging utilities

Remember that performance optimization is an iterative process. Always measure before and after implementing any optimization to ensure it provides the expected benefits.
