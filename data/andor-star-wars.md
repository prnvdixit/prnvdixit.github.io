## Mandatory warning

<b><u>Warning - 1</u></b>: Spoilers ahead!

<b><u>Warning - 2</u></b>: Yes it is political and brilliantly so. Star Wars has always been political. George Lucas drew so much inspiration from the Vietman War at the time, so it's only fitting for the story of Star Wars to revolve around politics! Themes of trade embargoes, media's disinformation and propaganda, genocides have always been common fascist themes - their current relevance is simply because history repeats itself

## Andor feels more like Star Wars

Andor is a treat for everyone, for fans and non-fans alike!

### Less Jedi shit

A lot of character development in Star Wars has been underwhelming, for lack of a better word. Your aunt and uncle got burned in a barn? A kid becomes a rebel. Your friend is a Jedi and you like your friends? A smuggler becomes a rebel. So much just revolved around a few characters. Most of the time, all that mattered, was whatever Jedi stuff was happening. To the extent where the battle against a fascist regime was secondary to Rey's romance with a Sith!

Andor goes back to what Star Wars was originally about: The Rebellion. Star Wars was supposed to be a fairytale about America flirting with fascism in the Nixonian and then post 9/11 era<sup><u>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_III_%E2%80%93_Revenge_of_the_Sith#Themes)</u></sup>. Andor dwells into those themes brilliantly! It goes deep into what instills political conciousness in a person enough to become a rebel, how rebels organize against a powerful oppressor, and what makes someone willing to risk everything for the rebellion.

### Things are actually hard

A lot of critics of the entire Star Wars saga, minus the original trilogy, have been about how they simplify the task of fighting against an omnipotent entity like the Empire. They somehow became more about the magical powers of some 3-4 individuals who will just show up at the end and swing their lightsabers and droids/stormtroopers will fall like LEGOs. It feels more like Marvel comics honestly!

Andor on the other hand is hyper focused on a human struggle and shows what an impossible task it is to fight against the Empire. However much you may disagree with the means adopted by Luthen or Andor you truly begin to admire why they're doing, what they do, because well they have no other option but to resist. I love the fact that the creators specifically aimed to not make Andor a "fan service"<sup><u>[2](https://screenrant.com/andor-show-star-wars-fan-service-details-response/)</u></sup>. Add to it the fact that blasters can aim for once!

### Honorable mention

I sense the irony here that you hear this critique of fascism and capitalism on Disney but as they say,

> When it comes time to hang the capitalists, they will fight with each other for the rope contract.

I think Nemik's manifesto is a fine touch, and a call to rebellion against the Galactic Empire. It serves as a structural bridge connecting personal stories of characters like Andor with the larger fight against the Empire.

> There will be times when the struggle seems impossible. I know this already. Alone, unsure, dwarfed by the scale of the enemy. Remember this. Freedom is a pure idea. It occurs spontaneously and without instruction. Random acts of insurrection are occurring constantly throughout the galaxy. There are whole armies, battalions that have no idea that they've already enlisted in the cause. Remember that the frontier of the Rebellion is everywhere. And even the smallest act of insurrection pushes our lines forward. And then remember this. The Imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so unnatural. Tyranny requires constant effort. It breaks, it leaks. Authority is brittle. Oppression is the mask of fear. Remember that. And know this, the day will come when all these skirmishes and battles, these moments of defiance will have flooded the banks of the Empire's authority and then there will be one too many. One single thing will break the siege. Remember this. Try.

## What made me think of this?

I just spent the last 3 days binge-watching both seasons of Andor and then Rogue one. I've been delaying watching Andor since it came out, well because I didn't like the recent Star Wars nonsense. Bhaiya convinced me to give Andor a try - and here we are!
