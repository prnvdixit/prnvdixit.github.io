## Why I thought of this today?

I was reading a very old journal entry of mine (reminds me I need to start journaling again!) and realised how frequently I've changed my opinion about things which I used to believe whole-heartedly at some point in life. Some times it happened over time with experiences, other times someone explicitly told me about it. And that is something I want to capture maybe as a trajectory of growth that is happening on a day-to-day basis in life. I can come back to it and remind myself of it then.

> This is a work in progress note, so I'll keep updating it when I come across other vices within me :)

## Judgmental

I believed there's only one way to live the life, the right way. Everything was so easy to cloak under "I have high standards", but the "standards" happen to just what was convenient to me. It was some level of insecurity within, where I felt good and reassured after pushing other people down, even so in my mind (never did it in practical life thankfully!).
I hope I can develop that empathy to other people's struggles and other people's choices.

## Fighting

Fighting right takes every little ounce of courage and empathy. Courage to accept that you're an avoidant, validator or volatile. Empathy to figure out your non-negotiables and negotiables. I'm still learning to convey my feelings instead of pointing fingers during the fight. And to take a break when I feel flooded with emotions.

## Putting self second

I realized a pattern in my relationships that I felt a constant need of reassurance. It likely originated from self-esteem issues. Where I'd rest a part of my identity with someone else. In these situations, my anxiety would take over, discipline will go to trash, and every disagreement seemed urgent turning into fights. Fortunately these relationships got over quickly too, so I never reached a point of being hurt by people leaving me.
Every new person I meet now is basically a guinea pig for I'll never let this side of me be known to anyone else. Patience is the only answer in these situations.
