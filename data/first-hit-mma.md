I started martial arts recently. And today, I had my first sparring session.

I volunteered to be the first one when the Master called. Having watched him spar with other guys over the last few weeks I was already planning my attack while in my corner before sparring started.

I ran through the strategy in my head:

"Oh, I can just throw a feint and when he lowers his guard, I'll punch. I need to keep my guard high to defend even while attacking; he's experienced, so I must wait for my opening. I have longer arms, so I can keep distance and still reach him"

And of course it was just sparring; neither of us was going to hit the other hard.

## When the blueprint fails

We were set for two one-minute sessions. We touched gloves, and it was on.

The first ten seconds were utterly confusing. His guard was nowhere near his face! What? Maybe he was trying to lure me into punching him or putting my own guard down?

I asked him, "Why aren't you defending?" He replied, "Don't worry about it. If I did, you wouldn't be able to hit me at all, and I want you to feel both - what hitting and being hit in a ring feels like"

I don't think I paid heed to the second part at the moment. My head was still running through my perfect plan. I tried to throw a jab towards his unguarded face expecting him to block it and give me an opening. But before my jab could even reach its target... Lo and behold! A lead hook slammed into my chest, and I felt as if all the air inside my lungs had been sucked out in that instant. I don't think the punch was hard at all, but I couldn't think clearly for a moment. My entire planning vanished. Thankfully, my guard was still up. He likely expected me to lower it on being punched in the abdomen, but I didn't. All subsequent punches to my face were blocked. In a single, painful heartbeat - I'd gone from an attacker to a survivor.

And thank God the bell rang. The first round was complete.

## Don't let get that win get to your head, literally!

While I was in my corner, my goal had shifted from landing a barrage of punches and using all my advantages to landing just a single, clean punch.

Things weren't looking good when the second round started either. He put his guard up this time and was casually throwing punches to my abdomen. I knew he was expecting me to put my guard down, but I didn't. I knew I'd be wide open if I did that. I was also keeping my distance from him and waiting for the right opportunity. I tried to tilt my body so that his jabs and crosses to my abdomen would hit some other point. But he shifted to hooks immediately, and another one landed and again, I felt as if all the air in my lungs had been evacuated.

Wearing a mouthguard for the first time wasn't a help either. I had been practicing breathing with my mouth, and now it was impossible. I "ran" towards my corner. He looked confused. He asked if I was hurt. I wasn't. I was just terrified and didn't know what to do. I turned around, threw away all earlier planning, and just trusted myself to react in the moment.

I went back to sparring after catching my breath for a couple of seconds and kept my distance. I saw his jab coming towards me from the corner of my eye. I leaned back, and he missed. For that split second, he was wide open. I charged towards him and landed a solid cross to his face. He didn't see it coming, or at least I thought so at the moment. But then I found his cross coming to my face. In my excitement, I had lunged right into his range. And I realized I wouldn't be able to get my hand back to my face in time. He wasn't wide open; I had been played so that I would come closer to him. My cross didn't even faze him, and he was still able to think properly and act in the moment. I didn't hit hard, but come on, it should have done something!

His well placed cross slammed into my face, and I felt a shiver cross through my body, my nose was burning. And the bell rang. My sparring was over.

## Learning from the ring

I didn't lose out on technique. I didn't make any technical mistakes at all - my guard was always up, I wasn't crossing my legs in footwork and I was never out of balance. Instead, my first sparring session was a harsh, physical lesson in the difference between theory and reality.

In my head, I was a tactician; In the ring, I was chaos. My Master didn't need to fight my plan; he just needed to introduce one unexpected, painful variable. All my advantages and my entire preparation - my height, my reach, my feints - were rendered useless by a single, well-placed body shot. And I just couldn't think straight when that plan failed. He, conversely, took a punch to his face and still remained unfazed enough to see an opening and hit back.

Life, like sparring, doesn't care about your advantage until you can endure the hit. Otherwise all your advantages are just in your mind.

I will remember that.
