# Vue.js 3 Composition API

An in-depth guide to understanding and effectively using Vue.js 3's Composition API, a revolutionary way to organize component logic.

## Introduction to Composition API

- Why Composition API?
- Comparison with Options API
- Setup function basics
- Lifecycle hooks

## Core Concepts

- Reactive References (ref)
- Reactive Objects (reactive)
- Computed Properties
- Watchers

## Component Organization

- Composables
- Shared State Management
- Code Reusability
- TypeScript Integration

## Best Practices

1. When to use refs vs reactive
2. Organizing composables
3. Error handling patterns
4. Performance optimization
5. Testing strategies

## Advanced Topics

### Dependency Injection

- Provide/Inject pattern
- Global state management
- Plugin development

### Performance Optimization

- Ref vs Reactive performance
- Computed property caching
- Async component loading

## Migration Strategies

- Migrating from Options API
- Hybrid approach
- Common pitfalls
- Migration tools

## Tools and Ecosystem

- DevTools integration
- IDE support
- Testing utilities
- Popular composables

Remember that the Composition API is not a replacement for the Options API, but rather an alternative that shines in specific use cases, particularly in larger applications with complex component logic.
