## Why F.R.I.E.N.D.S?

Very clickbaity title I know! In my defense I'm more of a movie/book person myself and haven't watched many TV shows yet. So, this analysis should hold for many famous TV shows (barring a few solid ones I know) – "The Office (US)," for example, would follow the same pattern.

### The first impression

In the first few episodes, you're introduced to lively characters, each with a unique personality and quirks that appear now and then. You quickly start feeling attached to these characters and their quirks, and can maybe see them resembling someone you know in real life.

Joey is a struggling actor who, despite his career and financial situation, has such a jolly outlook on life you immediately wish you knew someone like him. His quirks? He's self-sufficient, loves his friends, and oh! What a flirt.

Ross is a very smart paleontologist going through a divorce because his wife came out as gay. His quirk? Struggling with conflicting feelings towards his ex-wife and his gorgeous teenage crush, whom he was head over heels for.

Chandler is... (what does he do again? :D)... an introverted, witty person with such a pure heart. His quirk? Well, he's ready to commit but confused about his love life and where it's going, I guess.

Monica is an ambitious chef and the glue holding the group together. Her quirk? She has an OCD about cleaning.

Rachel is a rich-turned-poor girl trying to find her place, her quirk being a bit snobby. Phoebe is a gypsy gal stuck in New York, I guess, whose quirk is being unintentionally blunt, snarky, and even offensive.

### The second impression

Seasons pass, and subtly, the characters become more distant from normal people. The quirks become their entire personality, and every other dialogue is a joke. Show writers, optimizing to maintain audience interest, seem to reduce characters to just that ONE thing. They feel less human now, more performative. It starts feeling like their entire reason for living is to seek validation from an imaginary audience, who they believe will love them more if their quirks got quirkier.

Joey is legit braindead in later seasons; the guy who once knew how to turn off the heater and play guitar chords later struggled with simple French words. He was turned from a flirt to a womanizer. I wish writers had leaned into the early season Joey more and shown how intelligence comes in different forms.

Ross becomes just a depressed serial-divorcee. Anyone told they'd go through three divorces in their 20s would have a mental breakdown, and surprise? That's what happens to him. He's miserable, pulling off stupid acts for a sandwich or seducing his cousin in desperation. If you turn off the laugh track, you can actually feel bad for the guy<sup>[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H6Ux3l75Rc)</sup>.

Monica transforms from a lovely girl into an over-controlling maniac, willing to throw a frenzy and ruin her friend’s wedding because she couldn’t be in control.

Phoebe went from a chill, empathetic stoner (I hope?) - who wouldn't even keep a football-phone because it wasn't hers - to a really mean person, doing vile things like telling Chandler who Monica actually went to the room for, or bringing that soul-mate guy to Monica when she was already married. Just vile.

Chandler and Rachel showed growth, I feel. But that's not the topic of this note, so I'll not go into that much.

### Takeaway for real life?

I think there's a lesson here somewhere. From childhood, we're taught to differentiate ourselves through our uniqueness. But if we associate our entire self-worth and personality with that one unique thing, we risk becoming so different we aren't a real person anymore. I remember a guy in my school who used to tell teachers "I love you" or "I am proud of you" whenever they scolded him. For first few weeks, the entire class and even teachers joined in the laughter. Then, his statements stopped being sudden and pretty predictable for everyone (Teacher asks him to stand up > Teacher says something snarky > He blurts out a one-liner) and were met with silence; the scolding wouldn't stop even after a witty line. He assumed he needed to lean more into his quirk, the thing that made him "special." I don't think the class laughed ever again at his one-liners.

### What made me think of this?

The girl I'm seeing currently mentioned watching "Schitt's Creek"—a very funny show, she said, where characters have an arc from annoying to lovely. She recommended we watch a couple of early episodes together and continue if I like them. This made me think of all the good shows I've seen with character arcs (HIMYM is a wonderful example) and how it took time for characters to hit a point where change clicks. So, I immediately countered that if it's as good a show as she says, I should watch at least 15-20 episodes before I can form an opinion.
